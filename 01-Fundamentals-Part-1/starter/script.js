Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

let markMass;
let markHeight;
let johnMass;
let johnHeight;

markMass = 78
markHeight = 1.69

johnMass = 92
johnHeight = 1.95

// markMass = 95
// markHeight = 1.88

// johnMass = 85
// johnHeight = 1.76

const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2
const johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2

console.log(markBMI)
console.log(johnBMI)

let markHigherBMI;
markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI
console.log(markHigherBMI);

// CODING CHALLENGE #2
/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI.
The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. 
Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

let markMass;
let markHeight;
let johnMass;
let johnHeight;

markMass = 78
markHeight = 1.69

johnMass = 92
johnHeight = 1.95

const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2
const johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI})!`)
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI})!`)

// 2.20 - TYPE CONVERSION AND TYPE COERCION

// TYPE CONVERSION - when we manually change type

// Use Case: Website has input for user's birth year
const inputYear = '1987';
console.log(Number(inputYear)); // fixes the problem below.
//console.log(inputYear + 18); // this doesnt work because according to above it's a string not an integer
// however, the inputYear variable or value is not actually converted, it's still a string
console.log(Number(inputYear) + 18); // now it should read properly since you converted the inputYear in equation too

// NaN means not a valid number

// to coerce an integer into a string use the (String()) function
console.log(String(23));

// TYPE COERCION = when javascript does it for us
console.log('I am ' + 23 + ' years old');
// above is an example of type coercion, since there is a string, then integer, then string
// ultimately it outputs as a string

// not all operators do type coercion to string
console.log('23' - '10' - 3); // this gives us 10
// the minus operator triggered type coercion to go to an integer for everything.

// the same with plus operators changes the type coercion behavior
console.log('23' + '10' + 3); // this usually only happens with plus sign, since common for strings vs. other operators

// guess the outcome
let n = '1' + 1;
n = n - 1;
console.log(n);
// in first line n = a string of 11
// in second line the string of 11 will be coerced into integer 11 - 1 equaling 10 in the console

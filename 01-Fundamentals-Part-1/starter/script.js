Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

let markMass;
let markHeight;
let johnMass;
let johnHeight;

markMass = 78
markHeight = 1.69

johnMass = 92
johnHeight = 1.95

// markMass = 95
// markHeight = 1.88

// johnMass = 85
// johnHeight = 1.76

const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2
const johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2

console.log(markBMI)
console.log(johnBMI)

let markHigherBMI;
markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI
console.log(markHigherBMI);

const now = 2023;

const andrew = "I'm " + firstName + ', a ' + (now - birthYear) + " year old " + job + "."
// this is a pain to manage in javascript. in ES6 we have a better tool for this (template literals)
console.log(andrew)

// backticks signify template string
const andrewNew = `I'm ${firstName}, a ${now-birthYear} year old ${job}.`
console.log(andrewNew)
// a lot easier to manage, similar to python/powershell?
